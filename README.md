# Neural_Networks_in_Python

A repository of models/code used to create artificial neural networks in Python; the models/code included in this repository is not
built from TensorFlow, Keras, or similar; all activation functions, forward/back prop functions, cost functions and models are 
created from scratch in Python.

# Notes

## Simple L-Layer Neural Network

For some reason GitHub will not render the LaTeX code in the Cost Function markdown cell; it does, however, render just fine in Jupyter Notebook.
