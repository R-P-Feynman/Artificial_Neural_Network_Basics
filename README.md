# Artificial_Neural_Network_Basics

A repository of functions and models used to create artificial neural networks in Python and/or TensorFlow.

# Files

## Art_Creation_with_Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb

Neural Style Transfer model written in TensorFlow.  To run this you will need the imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat file which is unfortunately too large to upload to GitHub but can be found on Kaggle. You will also need starry.jpg and stpauls.jpg if you wish to run it on the same images used in the notebook.

## Hello_World_of_Deep_Learning.ipynb

A single neuron single layer network tasked to solve a simple problem in Keras.  Taken from deeplearning.ai.

## Optimization_Methods_in_Python.ipynb

Gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, momentum and Adam optimizers written from scratch in Python i.e. no TensorFlow or Keras; includes mathematical equations in LaTeX. 

## Residual_Network_ResNet-50_in_Keras

A 50-layer residual network for translating images of sign language.  Written in Keras.

## Simple_Convolutional_Neural_Network_in_Keras.ipynb

A simple convolutional neural network written in Keras.  To run this you will also need the test_happy.h5 and train_happy.h5 files.

## Simple_Convolutional_Neural_Network_in_Python.ipynb

A simple convolutional neural network written from scratch in Python i.e. no TensorFlow or Keras; includes mathematical equations in LaTeX. 

## Simple_Convolutional_Neural_Network_in_TensorFlow.ipynb

A simple convolutional neural network for translating images of sign language.  Written in TensorFlow.  To run this you will also need the test_signs.h5 and train_signs.h5 files.

## Simple_L-Layer_Neural_Network_in_Python.ipynb

A simple L-layer neural network written from scratch in Python i.e. no TensorFlow or Keras; includes mathematical equations in LaTeX.  For some reason GitHub will not render the LaTeX code in the Cost Function markdown cell; it does, however, render just fine in Jupyter Notebook.

## Simple_Neural_Network_in_TensorFlow.ipynb

A simple neural network for translating images of sign language.  Written in TensorFlow.  To run this you will also need the test_signs.h5 and train_signs.h5 files.

## TensorFlow_Basics.ipynb

Runs through the basics of TensorFlow using loss, cost, linear, sigmoid and one-hot encoding functions as examples.
