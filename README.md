# Neural_Networks_Basics

A repository of functions and models used to create artificial neural networks in Python and/or TensorFlow.

# Files

## Optimization Methods.ipynb

Gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, momentum and Adam optimizers written from scratch in Python i.e. no TensorFlow or Keras; includes mathematical equations in LaTeX. 

## Simple L-Layer Neural Network.ipynb

A simple L-layer neural network written from scratch in Python i.e. no TensorFlow or Keras; includes mathematical equations in LaTeX.  For some reason GitHub will not render the LaTeX code in the Cost Function markdown cell; it does, however, render just fine in Jupyter Notebook.
