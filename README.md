# Neural_Networks_Basics

A repository of functions and models used to create artificial neural networks in Python and/or TensorFlow.

# Files

## Optimization Methods.ipynb

Gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, momentum and Adam optimizers written from scratch in Python i.e. no TensorFlow or Keras; includes mathematical equations in LaTeX. 

## Simple L-Layer Neural Network.ipynb

A simple L-layer neural network written from scratch in Python i.e. no TensorFlow or Keras; includes mathematical equations in LaTeX.  For some reason GitHub will not render the LaTeX code in the Cost Function markdown cell; it does, however, render just fine in Jupyter Notebook.

## Simple_Neural_Network_in_TensorFlow.ipynb

A simple neural network for translating images of sign language.  Written in TensorFlow.  To run this you will also need the test_signs.h5 and train_signs.h5 files

## TensorFlow Basics.ipynb

Runs through the basics of TensorFlow using loss, cost, linear, sigmoid and one-hot encoding functions as examples.

## test_signs.h5

Test data for Simple_Neural_Network_in_TensorFlow.ipynb.

## train_signs.h5

Training data for Simple_Neural_Network_in_TensorFlow.ipynb.
