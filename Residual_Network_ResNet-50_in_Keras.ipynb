    "# Residual Network (ResNet-50) in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Very deep convolutional neural networks are hard to train thanks to vanishing gradients: during gradient descent, as backpropagation passes from the final layer through many layers to the first, the gradient can decrease exponentially to zero (or, less commonly, grow exponentially quickly and explode). \n",
    "\n",
    "Residual networks (ResNets), introduced by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), allow for the training of much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.  In this kind of architecture a 'shortcut' or a 'skip connection' allows the gradient to be directly backpropagated to earlier layers.  Also, a ResNet block with such a shortcut makes it very easy for that block to learn an identity function, and there is some evidence to suggest this is also important when it comes to ResNets' remarkable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the code in Keras to create a ResNet tasked with translating images of sign language. The data being used is a subset of the SIGNS dataset and is contained within the test_signs.h5 and train_signs.h5 files; these need to be placed in a folder named 'datasets' and then that folder needs to be placed in the same location as this notebook file."
